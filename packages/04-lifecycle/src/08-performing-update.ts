 * Performing an update
 * When an update is performed, the `performUpdate()` method is called. This method calls a number of other lifecycle methods.

 * Any changes that would normally trigger an update which occur while a component is updating do not schedule a new update. 
 * This is done so that property values can be computed during the update process. Properties changed during the update 
 * are reflected in the `changedProperties` map, so subsequent lifecycle methods can act on the changes.
