   * Lit behavior
   * Pauses the reactive update cycle. It is resumed when the element is connected.
   *
   * Use cases
   * This callback is the main signal to the element that it may no longer be used;
   * as such, disconnectedCallback() should ensure that nothing is holding a reference to the element
   * (such as event listeners added to nodes external to the element), so that it is free to be garbage collected.
   *
   * No need to remove internal event listeners.
   * You don't need to remove event listeners added on the component's own DOMâ€”including those added declaratively in your template.
   * Unlike external event listeners, these won't prevent the component from being garbage collected.
