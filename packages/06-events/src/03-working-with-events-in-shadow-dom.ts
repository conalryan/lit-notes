/**
 * By default, an event dispatched inside a shadow root will not be visible outside that shadow root.
 * To make an event pass through shadow DOM boundaries, you must set the `composed` property to true.
 * It's common to pair `composed` with `bubbles` so that all nodes in the DOM tree can see the event
 *
 * If an event is composed and does bubble, it can be received by all ancestors of the element that dispatches
 * the eventâ€”including ancestors in outer shadow roots. If an event is composed but does not bubble,
 * it can only be received on the element that dispatches the event and on the host element containing the shadow root.
 *
 * Note that most standard user interface events, including all mouse, touch, and keyboard events,
 * are both bubbling and composed.
 *
 * Understanding event retargeting
 * Composed events dispatched from within a shadow root are retargeted, meaning that to any listener on
 * an element hosting a shadow root or any of its ancestors, they appear to come from the hosting element.
 * Since Lit components render into shadow roots, all composed events dispatched from inside a Lit component
 * appear to be dispatched by the Lit component itself. The event's target property is the Lit component.
 *
 * In advanced cases where it is required to determine the origin of an event, use the event.composedPath() API.
 * This method returns an array of all the nodes traversed by the event dispatch, including those within shadow roots.
 * Because this breaks encapsulation, care should be taken to avoid relying on implementation details that may be exposed.
 * Common use cases include determining if the element clicked was an anchor tag, for purposes of client-side routing.
 * ```ts
 * handleMyEvent(event) {
 *   console.log('Origin: ', event.composedPath()[0]);
 * }
 * ```
